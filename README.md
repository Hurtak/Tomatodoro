Tomatotim
==========

### Description

Application for time management inspired by technique called
[Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).
The technique uses a timer to break down your working time into
25 minutes long work periods separated by short breaks. The
method is based on the idea that frequent breaks can improve
mental agility.

The most common implementation is as follows:

<ol>
  <li>25 minutes of work</li>
  <li>5 minute break</li>
  <li>Repeat four times, after which you have a 20â€“30 minute break</li>
  <li>Start again</li>
</ol>
